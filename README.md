# LAN-Battleship
My first ever open source project that I've made ~2 years ago. Now that I've found it, why not publish it? :D (Code is garbage)

To use: Download a release -> Open -> Open on another Windows device -> Multiplayer -> Decide who gonna host -> Let other player input host's internal IP address.

You can also play vs easy/mid/hard bots :)
